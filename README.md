10 beginner-friendly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects built during 1st semester break for practice and foundation building.

# 🚀 JavaScript Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly JavaScript projects built as part of my learning journey in web development. These projects helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build interactive web applications.

I initially followed tutorials to complete these projects and later plan to revisit and improve them as I strengthen my programming skills.
